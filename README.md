# 📊 Survey Analysis – Project README

## 🔹 Problem Statement  
A telecom company is experiencing a high customer churn rate, resulting in revenue loss and reduced customer lifetime value. The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior, identify patterns that lead to churn, and propose actionable strategies to reduce churn rates.

---

## 🔹 Objectives  
- Understand the factors that influence customer churn.  
- Explore customer behavior using descriptive and diagnostic analytics.  
- Build a prediction model to identify high-risk customers.  
- Develop actionable business recommendations supported by data.  
- Present insights through an interactive dashboard and clear report.

---

## 🔹 Tools Used  
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **SQL:** PostgreSQL (for querying customer segments)  
- **Power BI:** dashboard design and key metrics visualization  
- **Excel:** initial exploration and data checks  
- **GitHub:** version control and documentation  

---

## 🔹 Dataset Explanation  
The dataset contains **7,043 customer records** from a telecom company with:  
- **Demographic data** (gender, age, partner/dependents)  
- **Account details** (contract type, payment method, tenure)  
- **Service usage** (internet service, streaming, tech support)  
- **Billing information** (monthly charges, total charges)  
- **Churn label** indicating whether the customer left or stayed  

The target variable is:  
`Churn` → *Yes / No*

## 🔹 Approach Summary  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, removed duplicates.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis:**  
   - Identified churn patterns by demographics, tenure, services, and billing.  

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Created tenure groups, payment categories, and binary service indicators.  

4. **Modeling:**  
   - Built and evaluated Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.  

5. **Visualization & Reporting:**  
   - Designed Power BI dashboard and compiled findings into a presentation.

---

## 🔹 Key Insights  
- **Month-to-month contract customers churn 3× more** than yearly contract customers.  
- Customers with **high service complaints and no tech support** have the highest churn tendency.  
- **Tenure < 6 months** remains the strongest indicator of churn.  
- Customers on **fiber internet** churn more, likely due to service quality issues.  
- Higher churn probability among customers with **automatic monthly billing**.

# 📊 2025 Hearing Wellness Survey Analysis – Project README

## 🔹 Problem Statement  
Prolonged earphone and headphone use is increasing hearing-related risks across India, yet many individuals continue to avoid hearing assessments due to low awareness, accessibility challenges, and limited engagement with digital health solutions. The Hearing Wellness Survey 2025 highlights these gaps, revealing the need to better understand public perceptions, habits, and barriers to adopting hearing-care tools.
